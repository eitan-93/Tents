# Tents

(The game tents - https://www.brainbashers.com/tents.asp) 

Defining, analyzing and solving a given algorithmic problem through multiple approaches (e.g. reduction to SAT and using linear programming).

The given problem here is the game tents - https://www.brainbashers.com/tents.asp) 

Challenges and technologies :

• Analyzing scientific articles in order to define efficient SAT Boolean expressions.

• Defining and Implementing an algorithm that generates an instance to the given problem in polynomial time.

• Using Java, Java SAT (SAT4J, sat4j-master) and ILP (lp-solver-java-master pack -> com.google.ortools.jar) libraries in order to implement and test our theoretical solution.

*The libraries are not attached here.

*There is an extended pdf (in hebrew) explaining the math behing our two algorithms.
